                The show takes place entirely at the Elsinore. It's a music
                venue & hotel with a storied history, deep in a city that
                resembles the Lower East Side in the early 90s but in
                <b>alternate future</b>
              </p>

              <h2>Plot</h2>
              <p>
                Without getting into spoilers...Hamlet is a melancholy young
                man. His father has recently died, and his mother married his
                uncle very shortly after. The ghost of his father appears to him
                and reveals that he was murdered. Hamlet decides to feign
                insanity in order to prove his uncle's guilt, though as the play
                goes on we begin to wonder what is faked or not.
