              <h1>A mini-guide to Perchance to Dream:</h1>
              <p>
                Perchance to Dream takes place in a world much like our own,
                where <b>algorithms replace human connection</b>, creative
                expression is commodified.
              </p>
              <p>
                We seek to <b>push the boundaries of live performance</b>, where
                the audience themselves are immersed in the story through the
                very technology that increasingly keeps us apart.
              </p>

              <h2>Plot</h2>
              <p>
                The show follows the story of Hamlet. Without getting too
                spoilery...Hamlet is a melancholy young man. His father has
                recently died, and his mother married his uncle very shortly
                after. The ghost of his father appears to him and reveals that
                he was murdered. Hamlet decides to feign insanity in order to
                prove his uncle's guilt, though as the play goes on we begin to
                wonder what is faked or not.

                    Perchance to Dream takes place entirely at the Elsinore.
                    It's a music venue & apartment with a storied history, deep
                    in a city that resembles the Lower East Side in the early
                    90s but <b>transported to the future</b>, in a world that
                    resembles, though is not, our own.

                    We imagine the costumes to be Elizabethan-punk. Taking
                    inspiration from 90s films such as the Matrix, plus
                    Elizabethan embellishments like lace collars and dramatic
                    sleeves.
